== FIRST-TIME INSTALL ==

Just copy the htdocs folder inside your dolibarr folder (overwrite dolibarr/htdocs folder).

Then in Configuration>Modules menu, you can activate and configure your CustomFields.

NOTE: you should DISABLE then RENABLE the module if already enabled (this allow to refresh the CustomFields hooks informations).

== UPDATE ==

If you already had an earlier version of CustomFields installed, you should first delete all CustomFields files.

1- Backup your CustomFields folder (/htdocs/customfields) and your overloading functions (/htdocs/customfields/fields/customfields_fields_extend.lib.php) and also your whole database. Making a backup of these two things is easy, fast and will ensure that you can completely go back in case you encounter a problem.
For more informations on the backup procedure, please read the Dolibarr's wiki: http://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Backups
 
2- Delete all previous files: Simply search from /htdocs/ for all files containing "customfields" in the name and delete them.
WARNING: this will also delete your language files. You can backup them prior to updating (they reside in /htdocs/customfields/langs/ folder), and then recopy them back when you finish the update.
WARNING2: Be careful not to overwrite your overloading functions file nor your language files if you have modified them! The overloading functions file resides inside /htdocs/customfields/fields/customfields_fields_extend.lib.php

3- Proceed to the same procedure as for a first time install (copy the files inside the archive, then disable/renable the module).

== MORE INFORMATIONS ==

You can read the README-CF.txt file that resides inside the /htdocs/customfields/ folder for more informations on the usage of the module.
